{{ 30 }}
{{ off }}
While there    are enough characters   here to
fill
   at least one line, there is
plenty
of
            white space which will cause
a bit of confusion to the reader, yet
the {{ on }} format off command means  that
    the original formatting of
the lines
        must be preserved. In essence, the
command {{ 25 }} is ignored.
